This C++ code creates a simple console-based To-Do List application using STL. Users can add tasks, view them with checkboxes indicating completion ([âœ”] for done, [ ] for not done), mark tasks as complete, and delete tasks. Tasks are stored in a vector, each with a unique ID, description, and completion status. The program features a menu-driven interface to facilitate user interaction with the to-do list.
